=head1 UPGRADING FROM BEFORE 4.0.0

This documentation notes internals changes between the 3.8 and 4.0

or local customizations.  It is not an exhaustive list.

=item *

The deprecated classes RT::Action::Generic, RT::Condition::Generic and
RT::Search::Generic have been removed, but you shouldn't have been using them
anyway. You should have been using RT::Action, RT::Condition and RT::Search,
respectively.

=item *

The menu system has been reworked significantly; the C<Privileged> and
C<Unprivileged> callbacks in C<Elements/Tabs>, along with
L<RT::Interface::Web::Menu>, comprise the new menuing hooks.
