Greetings,

You are subscribed to a dashboard that is currently missing. Most likely, the dashboard was deleted.

RT will remove this subscription as it is no longer useful. Here's the information RT had about your subscription:

DashboardID:  { $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('DashboardId') }
Frequency:    { $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Frequency') }
Hour:         { $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Hour') }
{
    $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Frequency') eq 'weekly'
    ? "Day of week:  " . $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Dow')
    : $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Frequency') eq 'monthly'
      ? "Day of month: " . $SubscriptionObj->SubValue('Dom')
      : ''
}
}
},
);
