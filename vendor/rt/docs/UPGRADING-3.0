=head1 UPGRADING FROM 3.0.0 AND EARLIER

=head2 Installation

We recommend you move your existing /opt/rt3 tree completely out
of the way before installing the new version of RT, to make sure
that you don't inadvertently leave old files hanging around.


=head2 Rights changes

Now, if you want RT to automatically create new users upon ticket
submission, you MUST grant 'Everyone' the right to create tickets.
Granting this right only to "Unprivileged Users" is now insufficient.


=head2 Web server configuration

The configuration for RT's web interface has changed.  Please refer to
docs/web_deployment.pod for instructions.
