# This is used by t/web/articles-links.t. Since we fork off a server
# under most test configurations, and we need a way to run code in the
# middle of the test script, we have to play at shenanigans to delete
# RT::Article's Name method. Other options were a Plack::Middleware that
# eval'd code given by paths like /__perl/(.+) (is scary), a signal
# handler (fails under apache), and only running articles-links.t for
# inline tests (fails under apache and standalone)
